<h2 id="section-1">Introduction to VID</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating custom user interfaces is easy with VID. In half an hour
you can learn how to use VID to create useful interfaces in {red}Red{black}.</p>
<ul>
*VID* is the */Visual Interface Dialect/*, a dialect of the Red language
that is built into every instance of Red. VID provides a powerful
method of describing user interfaces, yet VID is simple to learn.
In addition, VID provides a smooth path from basic user interfaces
to sophisticated applications.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-1.1">Creating VID Scripts</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Any text editor can be used to create a VID script.  You can
build the text editor in Red or use your own favorite editor.
Save your file as text, then run it with Red.</p>
<p>!Note: Using a word processor like /Word/ or /Wordpad/ is not
recommended unless you save your files as text. Saving as
a doc file will not work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-2">Minimal Example</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As a minimal example, you can create a window that displays a
line of text using just one line of code.  Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
  view [text "Hello Red World!"]
</pre>
<p>You can also display buttons and other gadgets using a single
line.  The example below will display a list of files and a
button:</p>
<pre>
  view [below text-list data read %. button "OK"]
</pre>
<p>!If you are executing this file in Red you can click on the
examples above to see how they will appear on your screen.
Click on their close box to remove them.  All of the examples
that follow can be viewed this way.</p>
<p>!You can also play with the example code by ctrl-clicking on it.
Edit the code in area and push "Show" button to see the result.
Push "Close" to close the window or just click on some other
example to work with it. If needed, resize the window.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-3">Two Basic Functions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Two functions are used to create graphical user interfaces
in Red: /*view*/ and /*layout*/.</p>
<p>The *layout* function creates a set of graphical objects.  These
objects are called *faces*.  You describe faces by providing
descriptions in a block that is passed to the layout function.</p>
<p>The *view* function displays faces that were previously created
by the layout function. The example below shows how the result
of the layout function is passed to the view function, and the
layout is displayed.</p>
<pre>
  view layout [below text "This is just an example." button "Ok"]
</pre>
<p>While you may call layout function explicitly, view function
can call it implicitly for you to make things even simpler:</p>
<pre>
  view [below text "This is just an example." button "Ok"]
</pre>
<p>Click on the above examples to view them (if you are executing this
file in Red).</p>
<p>!Note: the block provided to a layout or view is not normal Red
code, but actually a dialect (VID) of Red.  Using a dialect
makes it much easier for you to express user interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-4">Window attributes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Attributes that determine window's general appearance -
/*size*/, /*title*/, and /*backdrop*/ - have to appear
in the beginning of VID block.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.1">Size</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Layout function will automatically calculate the window size from
the VID block, so you don't generally need to provide size.</p>
<pre>
  view [text "Window size is calculated automatically."]
</pre>
<p>However, you can give your window predetermined size:</p>
<pre>
  view [size 200x150 text "Thus."]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.2">Title</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Title is specified with keyword *title* followed by string.
If no title is specified "Red: untitled" will appear on title bar.</p>
<pre>
  view [size 250x50 title "Example"]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-4.3">Backdrop</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>About *backdrop* keyword see below.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-5">Layout flow</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>By default faces will be placed across the window from left to right.</p>
<pre>
  view [field "Enter data" text "Press button" button "OK"]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-5.1">Return</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To return to the beginning of next row use *return*:</p>
<pre>
  view [text "Data:" field return text "Press button" button "OK"]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-5.2">Below and across</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>But you can also change the default flow direction by kewords
*below* and *across*. Layout function will remember the change position.</p>
<pre>
  view [
    text "Data:" 
    below field hint "First" 
    across field hint "Second" 
    button "OK"
  ]
</pre>
<p>If currrent flow is /below/, /return/ will bring you to start of next column:</p>
<pre>
  view [below field "F1" field "F2" return field "F3" button "OK"]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-6">Layout spacings</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>By default layout function starts from 10x10 and spaces faces 10pt across
and 10pt below each other. To change this behaviour use *origin* and *space*
keywords:</p>
<pre>
  view [
    origin 0x0 space 0x0 
    field "F1" field "F2" return 
    field "F3" field "F4"
  ]
</pre>
<p>When you want to change spacing for individual face, use *pad*.
But remember that after pad flow continues from padded position:</p>
<pre>
  view [pad 0x5 text "Button" pad 0x-10 button field]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-6.1">`At` keyword</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With *at* keyword you can take a face out of the flow altogether,
and put it at specific position without affecting the flow of
other faces:</p>
<pre>
  view [
    origin 30x30 
    text "Normal flow" button "OK"
    at 0x0 text "Out of flow"
  ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-7">Styles</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Styles* describe *faces* in VID.  The examples above use the text, field
and button styles to specify a text line, a push button and text entry field.
Red has 27 predefined styles, and you can easily create your own custom
styles.  Here are a few example styles used with layout:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  view [
    below
    h4 "Style Examples"
    box red 240x2
    text bold "There are 27 styles built into Red. Some examples:"
    button "Button"
    across
    text "Tab-panel:" 60 tab-panel 200x125 [
      "Text-list" [text-list 120x80 data ["this" "is" "text-list"]]
      "Drop-list" [drop-list 120x80 data ["this" "is" "drop-list"]]
      "Drop-down" [drop-down 120x80 data ["this" "is" "drop-down"]]
    ] return
    check "Checkbox"
    radio "Radio-1" radio "Radio-2"  return 
    text "Field:" 60 field 100 hint "Text Entry Field" return
    text 60 "Area:" area return
    group-box "Group-box" [
      below
      text "Slider:" slider 80%
      text "Progress:" progress data 40%
    ]
  ]
</pre>
<p>The words like /h4/, /box/, /text/, /button/, /text-list/, /check/, /radio/,
and /field/ are styles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-8">Facets</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Facets* let you modify a style.  For instance, you can change
the /text/, /color/, /size/, /font/, /image/, and other facets of a style.</li>
</ul>
<p>In VID, facets are modified by keywords or values of corresponding
datatypes. For simplicity, let's call them all facets fo now. Facets follow
the style name.  Here is an example that shows how you modify the text
style to be {navy}*bold and navy blue*{black}:</p>
<pre>
  view [text bold font-color navy "Facets are easy to use."]
</pre>
<p>The words /bold/ and /navy/ are not styles.  They are values that
modify font facet of a style.</p>
<p>Facets can appear in any order, so you don't have to remember
which one goes first.  For example, the line above could be
written as:</p>
<pre>
  view [text "Facets are easy to use." font-color navy bold]
</pre>
<p>There are many facets that can be used.  Here is an example that
creates {#black#} {red}*bold red*{black} {#} text centered in a black box.</p>
<pre>
  view [text 300 bold black red center "Red Text"]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-9">Custom Styles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating custom styles saves time.  When you define a custom style,
the facets you need go into the style.  This reduces what you need
to specify each time you use the style, and it allows you to modify
the look of your interface by changing the style definitions.</p>
<p>For example, here is a layout that defines a style for square
buttons.  The style word defines the new style, followed by the
old style name and its facets.</p>
<pre>
  view [
    below
    style square: button 50x50
    text "Testing button style:"
    square "Test"
    square "Red"
    button "Normal"
  ]
</pre>
<p>So, if you wanted to create a text style for [10]{#silver#}
{yellow}*_big, bold, underlined, yellow_*{black} {#}[] text:</p>
<pre>
  view [
    backdrop silver below
    style yell: text bold underline silver yellow font-size 16
    yell "Hello!!"
    yell "This is big old text."
    yell "Goodbye!"
  ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-10">Note About Examples</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>!From this point forward, all examples will assume that the view
function is provided and face flow is set to below.  Only the layout
block contents will be shown.  To use these examples in your scripts,
you will need to put them in a layout block and set flow to below,
as was shown earlier.</p>
<p>For example, code that is written as:</p>
<pre>
  view [
    below
    text "Layout examples"
    button "Test it"
  ]
</pre>
<p>will now appear as:</p>
<pre>
  text "Layout examples"
  button "Test it"
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-11">Face Sizes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The size of a face depends on its style.  Most styles, such as buttons,
boxes, checks, text-lists, and fields, have a convenient default
size.  Here are some examples:</p>
<pre>
  button "Button"
  box blue
  field
  text-list
</pre>
<p>If no size is given, text's size is automatically computed, and face's
size is increased if text is larger than default size of the face.
Images will use whatever their source size is:</p>
<pre>
  text silver "Short"
  text silver "Short text line"
  text silver "This is a much longer line of text than that above."
  button "Longer text on button"
  image %ferns.jpg
</pre>
<p>You can change the size of any face by providing a value for size facet.
The size can be an integer or a pair.  An integer specifies the width
of the face. A pair specifies both width and height. Images will be
stretched to fit the size.</p>
<pre>
  button 200 "Big Button"
  button 200x100 "Huge Button"
  image %ferns.jpg 50x50
  image %ferns.jpg 150x50
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-12">Color Facets</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Most styles have a default color.  For example the text styles will default
to a /black/ text on /snow/ background.  To modify the color of a face, provide
a color facet:</p>
<pre>
  area red "Red area"
  box orange "Orange box"
</pre>
<p>Colors can also be specifed as tuples. Each tuple contains three
numbers: the red, green, and blue components of the color. Each
component can range from 0 to 255. For example:</p>
<pre>
  box 200.0.200 "Red + Blue = Magenta" 200
  field 0.200.200 "Green + Blue"
</pre>
<p>Some face styles also allow more than one color.  The first color
will be used for the background and the second color for the font
of the text:</p>
<pre>
  text "Yellow on red background" red yellow
  h5 "White on Navy Blue" navy white
  box "Multicolor" olive red
  text-list blue orange data ["One" "Two" "Three"]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-13">Text Facets</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Most faces will accept text to be displayed.  Even graphical
faces can display text.  For example, the box and image faces
will display text if it is provided:</p>
<pre>
  box blue "Box Face"
  image %ferns.jpg bold "Image Face"
</pre>
<p>Some faces need to show more than one text string. The
strings will be shown in list.</p>
<pre>
  text-list 80x50 data ["Up" "Down"]
  drop-list data [
    "Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday" "Thursday" "Friday"
  ]
  drop-down data [
    "January" "February" "March" "April" "May" "..."
  ]
</pre>
<p>When other datatypes need to be displayed as text, use the *form*
function to convert them first:</p>
<pre>
  button 200 (form now)
  field (form first read %.)
</pre>
<p>!Note that in last example parens are used to evaluate expressions.
To use this feature in your script use `compose` command before
layout block. Like this:</p>
<pre>
  view compose [button 200 (form now)]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-14">Text Style</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>By default text is dark on light and can include a number of facets
to set the font, style, color, size and other attributes.</p>
<pre>
  text "Normal"
  text "Bold" bold
  text "Italic" italic
  text "Underline" underline
  text "Bold italic underline" bold italic underline
  text "Big red text" font-size 32 font-color red
  text "Serif style text" font-name font-serif
</pre>
<p>Text also includes these predefined styles:</p>
<pre>
  h1 "Heading 1"
  h2 "Heading 2"
  h3 "Heading 3"
  h4 "Heading 4"
  h5 "Heading 5"
</pre>
<p>There are also alignment keywords: /left, center,
right, top, middle, bottom/:</p>
<pre>
  box 300x100 "Right, middle" right middle
</pre>
<p>Some faces, like /text/, wrap by default, others, like /area/, do not:</p>
<pre>
  text no-wrap 100x80 "Not wrapping longer text than fits the face"
  area wrap 100x80 "Wrapping longer text than fits the face"
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-15">Text Entry Fields</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Text input fields are field and area.  A text input field can
be created with:</p>
<pre>
  field
</pre>
<p>Field accepts hint:</p>
<pre>
  field hint "Password"
</pre>
<p>Fields will scroll when necessary.  To make the field larger or smaller,
provide a width:</p>
<pre>
  field 30 field 300
</pre>
<p>Larger amounts of text can be entered in an area.  Areas also
accept an enter key and will break lines.</p>
<pre>
  area
</pre>
<p>You can also specify the area size:</p>
<pre>
  area 160x200
</pre>
<p>To force the text in an area to wrap rather than scroll
horizontally, provide the wrap option:</p>
<pre>
  area wrap
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-16">List boxes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>List-boxes are *text-list*, *drop-list* and *drop-down*. First
creates a box with list of selections, second a drop list of selections
and third a field with drop-down selection list.</p>
<p>List boxes are easy to create with block of strings in /data/ facet.
Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
  text-list data ["Eureka" "Ukiah" "Mendocino"]
</pre>
<p>Provided block may contain different types of elements but only
string-based types are shown.  Here is example of block with
mixed types:</p>
<pre>
  drop-list data ["First" 1 "Second" two "Third" [3]]
</pre>
<p>String-based types are formed into standard strings.  Here is a
list of all the files in your current directory:</p>
<pre>
  drop-down data read %.
</pre>
<p>If not "stringy", elements you want to be displayed need to be
converted to strings first.  Here is a list of all the words Red
has scanned:</p>
<pre>
  text-list data split form words-of :system/words space
</pre>
<p>You can pre-select one of entries in list by by providing *select*
keyword:</p>
<pre>
  drop-list data ["January" "February" "March"] select 2
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-17">Panels or Face-Groups</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For grouping faces the standard way is to use either *panel*:</p>
<pre>
  across text "Before"
  panel [below field field button]
  text "After"
</pre>
<p>or *tab-panel* for several groups:</p>
<pre>
  tab-panel [
    "First" [h3 "First tab"]
    "Second" [h3 "Second tab"]
  ]
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Group-box* is a temeporary face and does not well resize, but in
static layouts it can be used with a string showing group's description:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  group-box "Group-box demo" [
    field field return button "OK"
  ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-18">Images</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>By default an image will be scaled to fit within a face.</p>
<pre>
  image 60x60 %ferns.jpg
  image 150x150 %ferns.jpg
</pre>
<p>Some other faces can accept an image as well as text:</p>
<pre>
  box 100x100 %ferns.jpg "This is box"
  button 60x30 "Button" %ferns.jpg
  panel bold "This is a panel." %ferns.jpg [field button]
</pre>
<p>The image can be provided as a filename, URL, or image data.</p>
<pre>
  image http://www.rebol.com/view/reb/ferns.jpg
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-19">Backdrops</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A backdrop can be a color or an image.  For example a backdrop
color would be written as:</p>
<pre>
  backdrop navy
  h4 "Color Backdrop" font-color gold
</pre>
<p>A backdrop image can be a file, URL, or image data:</p>
<pre>
  backdrop %ferns.jpg
  box "Image Backdrop" bold font [color: white size: 18]
</pre>
<p>And here is url backdrop:</p>
<pre>
  backdrop http://www.rebol.com/view/reb/ferns.jpg
  box "Image with url backdrop" bold font [color: white size: 18]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-20">Actions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>An action can be associated with any face. To do so,
follow the face style with a block:</p>
<pre>
  button "Test" [print "test"]
</pre>
<p>The block is used as the body of default function that is passed
the face and event.  For example:</p>
<pre>
  button "Do it!" [print [face/text event/type]]
  text "Old text" [
    old: "Old text" new: "New text" 
    face/text: either old = face/text [new][old] 
  ]
</pre>
<p>There are many actions you can call based on different events.
To call a non-default action put the action name before the block:</p>
<pre>
  text-list data ["A" "B" "C"] on-change [
    print pick face/data face/selected
  ]
</pre>
<p>Use facets to modify the contents or state of other faces.
For example, the slider will update the progress bar:</p>
<pre>
  slider 200x16 [p1/data: face/data]
  p1: progress
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-21">Naming faces</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>To refer to face's facets in actors you can use either /face/ to
refer to the actors owner-face:</p>
<pre>
  text-list data ["Monday" "Tuesday" "Wednesday"][
    print pick face/data face/selected
  ]
</pre>
<h5 id="section-21">or you can name other faces and refer to them by their name:</h5>
<pre>
  drop-list data read %. [
    txt/text: read pick face/data face/selected
  ]
  txt: area 500x300
</pre>
<p>There are many actors, but not all of them work for all faces.
Faces do have default actors which may be defined without proper
naming, other actor have to be specified by name:</p>
<pre>
  base 150x50 white "Press mouse-button or key-board"
  on-down [face/text: "Left-button down"]
  on-up [face/text: "Left-button up"]
  on-alt-down [face/text: "Right-button down"]
  on-alt-up [face/text: "Right-button up"]
  on-key [face/text: rejoin [#"^"" event/key {" pressed}]]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-22">Incapacitating faces</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>disabled* and *hidden* let you, well, disable and hide faces.
Notice that VID keyword and face object's property are "negative
mirrors" of each other:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  f: field disabled button "Enable" [
    switch face/text [
      "Enable" [f/enabled?: yes face/text: "Disable"]
      "Disable" [f/enabled?: no face/text: "Enable"]
    ]
  ]
</pre>
<ul>
<li>hidden* behaves in similar way:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  b: box red hidden 
  button "Show" [
    switch face/text [
      "Show" [b/visible?: yes face/text: "Hide"]
      "Hide" [b/visible?: no face/text: "Show"]
    ]
  ]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-23">More keywords</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There are several keywords more you need to become acquainted with,
like *loose*, *focus*, *extra*.</p>
<ul>
<li>loose* lets your faces literally loose, so that you can drag these around.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  box red loose field loose button loose
</pre>
<ul>
<li>focus* give specific face the initial focus, so that you can, e.g.
start immediately typing.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
  area focus wrap button "Send"
</pre>

</ul>
<pre>
  tl: text-list data read %. extra [] on-change [
    append face/extra pick face/data face/selected
  ]
  button "Show" [view/flags [text-list data tl/extra] [modal popup]]
